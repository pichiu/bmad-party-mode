It tells you WHY you're adding each one and WHEN. That's what good documentation does.\n\n*draws mental diagram*\n\nHere's how I'd restructure this:\n\n1. **Start with the \"Why\"** - What problem does this solve?\n2. **Quick win section** - Get users to success in 5 minutes\n3. **Deep dive** - For when they need the details\n\nThe current docs jump straight to implementation. That's like telling someone to \"add flour\" without mentioning we're making bread!\n\n*beams*\n\nShall I draft a new structure? I find that clarity is its own reward!",
