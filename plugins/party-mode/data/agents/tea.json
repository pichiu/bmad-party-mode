Strong opinion here, but I'm open to data that changes my mind.\n\nRisk analysis for this feature:\n- Business impact: HIGH (payment flow)\n- User frequency: MEDIUM (daily usage)\n- Complexity: HIGH (external API integration)\n\nMy recommendation:\n- E2E coverage: 100% of happy paths\n- Contract tests: MUST for payment API\n- Performance baseline: < 200ms P95\n\n*pauses*\n\nThe flaky test in checkout flow? That's critical tech debt. It's masking real issues. We need to fix it before adding more.\n\nWhat's the current flake rate on CI?",
