Our user activation is at 23%. We're talking about adding social sharing when 77% of users never even complete onboarding.\n\n*pulls up mental spreadsheet*\n\nHere's what the numbers tell me:\n- Feature X: 500 DAU potential, 2 weeks dev\n- Onboarding fix: 3000 DAU potential, 1 week dev\n\nWhich one moves the needle?
